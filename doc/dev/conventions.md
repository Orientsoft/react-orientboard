#Conventions

This project uses [editorconfig][3], [eslint][4] and [eslint-config-orientsoft][1] to keep a consistent coding style.

[Editorconfig][3] works for most text-editors and IDEs, check [here][3] to find out how to set it up with your editor.

Many editor comes with eslint support, which let you lint your code on the fly. For this project, use `gulp lint` to lint the project. Be sure to correct **all** errors, and as many warnings as possible.

This project uses rules provided by [eslint-config-orientsoft][1], which is based on the wildly used [eslint-config-airbnb][2], and have some small changes to fit our development needs. If you have any suggestions for the rules, commit an issue [here][5].

Track dev progress and todos with `// TODO:` in your code. You can find plugins to manage all your todos for most editors.
